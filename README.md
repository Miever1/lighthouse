# Lighthouse for Performance Monitoring

Lighthouse is a tool I use to monitor the performance of my personal website. It helps me stay aware of the quality of my code and ensures that the site meets high performance standards.

By regularly running Lighthouse audits, I can:
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Improve accessibility
- Ensure best practices
- Optimize SEO

You can view the detailed performance reports at [Lighthouse Report](https://lighthouse-report.miever.net/).

This monitoring process keeps my website fast, user-friendly, and easy to maintain.
